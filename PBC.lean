/- `Periodic boundary conditions (PBCs)` are essential in MD simulations to avoid surface or edge effects 
that can disrupt the bulk behavior of a system. By simulating an `infinite` system, PBCs allow molecules 
that leave one side of the simulation box to re-enter from the opposite side, creating the effect of an 
unbounded environment.-/
